# Ahmed Saied and Oscar Wang

## Overview
a) Our goal is to design and improve a simple platform game involving switches, moving boxes, and jumping. Add the ability to avoid obstacles (Refer to README.md file for more information)

b) As a user, I can push boxes, jump, and flip switches, to progress through the level

c) The software runs. Once it runs, the user can control the robot character

d) The robot faces only one direction, even when moving the opposite way. There is only one level to play on which is pretty simple. There are no obstacles that the robot has to avoid.

e) The README.md gives a basic overview of the game. It also includes features to be added, things that must be refactored, and instructions on how to run and play the game. The README is pretty clear on what is lacking, but we could add a breakdown on how to find specific code for different aspects of the game

f) There are no descriptions for the targets because all are pretty intuitive. Also, there is no old legacy JWS data.

g) The issues are clearly layed out on the README. Things like a new physics engine, ability to turn around, and level expansion are listed. There are enough to points to get to 1000. 

h) We could a [flipping switch animation](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-alva/issues/11), and a [box-pushing animation](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-alva/issues/12)

i) The code is seperated into several classes; they are clear to understand and are connected through inheritance. The purposes of the classes and their methods are clear in that their names make their functions very intuitive. It is obvious how the classes are related to one another; again, inheritance through the usage of "extend." The code is easy to read and understand. If I were to give someone a screenful text to get the reader up to date, I'd tell them to take a look at GameMain.java and MainComp.java to understand the bigger picture and then look at the other java files for specific functions. 

j) There is no text coverage currently (this includes JUnit Test). There are opportunities to expand test coverage. We could create test files for all the classes that we expand on.
