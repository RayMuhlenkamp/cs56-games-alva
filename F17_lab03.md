# Ahmed Saied and Oscar Wang

## Overview
a) Our goal is to design and improve a simple platform game involving switches, moving boxes, and jumping. Add the ability to avoid obstacles (Refer to README.md file for more information)

b) As a user, I can push boxes, jump, and flip switches, to progress through the level

c) The software runs. Once it runs, the user can control the robot character

d) The robot faces only one direction, even when moving the opposite way. There is only one level to play on which is pretty simple. There are no obstacles that the robot has to avoid.

e) The README.md gives a basic overview of the game. It also includes features to be added, things that must be refactored, and instructions on how to run and play the game. The README is pretty clear on what is lacking, but we could add a breakdown on how to find specific code for different aspects of the game

f) There are no descriptions for the targets because all are pretty intuitive. Also, there is no old legacy JWS data.

g) The issues are clearly layed out on the README. Things like a new physics engine, ability to turn around, and level expansion are listed.

h) We could a [flipping switch animation](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-alva/issues/11), and a [box-pushing animation](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-alva/issues/12)

i) We should read the code first

j) We should read the code (especially testing code, if any)
