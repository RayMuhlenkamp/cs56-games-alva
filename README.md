# cs56-games-alva

This games objective is to create a fun and interesting platformer where you move boxes, flip switches, and avoid obstacles.

## Features to add:
* Adding obstacles to test players reaction time and ability
* Add an ultimate objective to the game, a way to win. Think the flag pole in Mario.
* Create a background
* Make new maps
* Make the player flip around when they move

## Things to refactor:
* The physics engine. It currently is slow and doesn't work that well. Look into AABX collision or another method that is more efficient.

## How to Run
To start the game, put "ant run" into the command line (no quotations).

## How to Play
To play, simply use A and D to move left and right. W is to jump. SPACE is used to flip switches when nearby. Hold F to grab boxes and move them.
